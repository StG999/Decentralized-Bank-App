# Decentralized Bank App

Welcome to the Decentralized Bank App, a basic banking application showcasing the capabilities of DFINITY's Internet Computer (ICP) and Motoko language. This app is built inside an ICP canister, providing a decentralized and secure environment for banking operations without the need for a traditional database management system.

## Features

1. **Add Money:** Users can add money to their account seamlessly.
2. **Withdraw Money:** Withdraw funds from the account effortlessly.
3. **Interest Calculation:** Whenever a deposit or withdrawal occurs, an interest rate of 0.1% compounded per second is added to the deposited amount.
4. **Real-time Compounding:** The interest rate is compounded every second, providing a practical demonstration of incremental growth.
5. **Reset Functionality:** A reset button allows users to clear the time counter and previous balance, returning the system to a new state with an opening balance of Rs 300.

## Technology Used

1. **Motoko:** The application is built entirely on Motoko, a programming language designed for the Internet Computer.
2. **ICP Hosting:** The app is hosted on the Internet Computer (ICP), leveraging the benefits of decentralized computing, enhanced security, and reliability.
3. **ICP Canister:** Both the frontend and backend of the application are hosted inside the same ICP canister, streamlining deployment and ensuring cohesion.

## How to Use

1. Visit the [Decentralized Bank App](https://wdh76-myaaa-aaaal-adoga-cai.icp0.io/) URL.
2. Use the "Add Money" and "Withdraw Money" buttons to manage your account balance.
3. Witness real-time interest compounding, demonstrating the growth of your deposited amount.
4. Press the "Reset" button to start afresh with a new current state and an opening balance of Rs 300.

**NOTE:** Always begin using the app after clicking the reset button. If you skip this, the interest would be compounded from the time the app was last used. This may lead to a very large account balance.
